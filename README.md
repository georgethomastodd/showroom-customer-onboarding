How does it work?
-----------------


How to use it?
--------------

You can use `ant` to build and deploy the example to an application server.
For that to work you need to copy the file `build.properties.example` to `build.properties`
and configure the path to your application server inside it.
Alternatively, you can also copy it to `${user.home}/.camunda/build.properties`
to have a central configuration that works with all projects generated by the
[Camunda BPM Maven Archetypes](http://docs.camunda.org/latest/guides/user-guide/#process-applications-maven-project-templates-archetypes).

Once you deployed the application you can run it using
its [web interface](http://localhost:8080/versicherungsneuantrag/online).
The use
[Camunda Tasklist](http://docs.camunda.org/latest/guides/user-guide/#tasklist)
to work on user tasks and inspect it using
[Camunda Cockpit](http://docs.camunda.org/latest/guides/user-guide/#cockpit).

In the file `src/main/webapp/app.js` you can switch between the two process versions.

Alternatively, you can also have a look at `NeuantragProcessTest`,
but before running it set your email address in `DemoData`.
